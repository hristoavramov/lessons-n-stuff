# Temperature Conversion

Create a program that requests a temperature in degrees Celsius from the user.

Then print the entered temperature in Fahrenheit, in Celsius and in Kelvin.

The formulas for the conversion are:
* `T_Fahrenheit = (T_Celsius * 9/5) + 32`
* `T_Kelvin = T_Celsius + 273.15`

Make sure no information is lost in the calculation! The result must always be a double.
