# Taco

Consider the given class `TacoBox`.

Create two implementations for this interface:
- `TripleTacoBox` always starts with 3 tacos in the box
- `CustomTacoBox` can contain as many tacos as are given to the constructor

Try out your classes by working with the interface as a type in the main method.
