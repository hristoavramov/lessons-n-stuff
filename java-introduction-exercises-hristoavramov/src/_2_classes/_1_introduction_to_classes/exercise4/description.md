# Static Methods

Consider the given class `Flat`.

Extend the class with the following methods:
- A method `public boolean largerThan(Flat toCompare)`
    which returns `true` if the given flat is larger than the flat being compared to
- A method `public int priceDifference(Flat toCompare)`
    which returns the price difference between the two flats

Now implement the following **static** methods in the `Flat` class:
- `public static boolean largerThan(Flat f1, Flat f2)`
- `public static int priceDifference(Flat f1, Flat f2)`

Try the methods in your main method.

(In general, it's better not to make methods static in an object-oriented program, unless there really is no other way).
