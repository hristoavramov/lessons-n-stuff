# User

Write a class `User` with:
- fields `first name`, `last name` and `age`
  - you should not be able to change the fields from outside the class
- a constructor that has the above fields as parameters
- a second constructor that has only `first name` and `last name` as fields,
    when calling this constructor, the `age` is set to 0
- a method `age()` that increases the age by 1
- a method `age(int number)` that increments the age by `number`
- a print output that looks like this `<first name> <last name> <age>`

Once your class is created do the following in the main method:
- Create two users
- Increase the age of one of them
- Print both to console
