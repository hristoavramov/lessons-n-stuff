# User with Address

Copy your class `User` from the previous exercise.

Now extend this class so that it also has a field of type `Address`. This field
is not passed along in the constructor but can be populated via a new method.

The new toString looks like this: `<first name> <last name> <age> lives in <street> <house number>, <postal code> <municipality>`"

You will have to write the class `Adress` yourself.

Experiment with your code in the main method.
