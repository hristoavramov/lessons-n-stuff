# Words that contain "AV"

Create a program that reads user input until the user enters an empty line.
For each non-empty line entered by the user, the input is split by spaces. Afterwards all words containing `av` are printed. 
It does not matter whether the letters occur in uppercase or lowercase.

```console
java is a programming language
java
navy blue shirt
navy
```
