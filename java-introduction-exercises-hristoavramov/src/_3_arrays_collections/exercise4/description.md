# Only these numbers

Create a program that reads in numbers until the user enters -1.

After reading the numbers, the program asks for a start and end index.

The program then prints all the numbers that fall between the start and end index (limits included).
You may assume that the user enters only possible values for the start and end index.

```console
72
2
8
11
-1
Start index? 1
End index? 2
2
8
```

```console
72
2
8
11
-1
Start index? 0
End index? 2
72
2
8
```
