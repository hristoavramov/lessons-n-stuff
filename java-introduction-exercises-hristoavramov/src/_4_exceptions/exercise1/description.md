# Average of numbers

Create a program that reads user input. If the input is `end` the program stops reading input.

Apart from `end`, a user can only enter numbers. 

* Show an error message if the user enters input other than a number or `end`. Use exceptions for this.
* After the user enters `end` print the average of all the numbers the user entered.

Example output:

```console
Enter numbers, type end to stop.
2
4
6
end
average: 4.0
```

```console
Enter numbers, type end to stop.
